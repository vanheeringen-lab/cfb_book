    "**How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "A string on the first logical line of a function is the *docstring* for that function.\n",
    "The convention followed for a docstring is a multi-line string where the first line starts with a\n",
    "capital letter and ends with a dot. Then the second line is blank followed by any detailed\n",
    "explanation starting from the third line. You are *strongly advised* to follow this convention for\n",
    "all your docstrings for all your non-trivial functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access the docstring of the `count_nuc` function using the `__doc__` (notice the *double\n",
    "underscores*) attribute (name belonging to) of the function.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you have used `help()` in Python, then you have already seen the\n",
    "usage of docstrings! What it does is just fetch the `__doc__`\n",
    "attribute of that function and displays it in a neat manner for\n",
    "you. You can try it out on the function above - just include `help(count_nuc)` in your\n",
    "program. Remember to press the `q` key to exit `help`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated tools can retrieve the documentation from your program in this manner. \n",
    "Therefore, we *strongly recommend* that you use docstrings for any non-trivial function that you write. \n",
    "The `pydoc` command that comes with your Python distribution works similarly to `help()` using docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From now on, *all*  your functions should be documented using a docstring!** \n",

    "3. Implement the function.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Python functions can be stored together in a *module*. A module, a collection of functions with a certain theme, can be *imported* by another program to make use of its functionality. This is how we can\n",
    "use the Python standard library as well. First, we will see how to use the standard library\n",
    "modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "File `module_using_sys.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~{.python}\n",
    "!INCLUDE \"code/module_using_sys.py\"\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run this program from the shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "~~~{.bash}\n",
    "$ python module_using_sys.py we are arguments\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "The command line arguments are:\n",
    "module_using_sys.py\n",
    "we\n",
    "are\n",
    "arguments\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we *import* the `sys` module using the `import` statement. Basically, this translates to us\n",
    "telling Python that we want to use this module. The `sys` module contains functionality related to\n",
    "the Python interpreter and its environment i.e. the **sys**tem.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python executes the `import sys` statement, it looks for the `sys` module. In this case, it is\n",
    "one of the built-in modules, and hence Python knows where to find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it was not a compiled module i.e. a module written in Python, then the Python interpreter will\n",
    "search for it in the directories listed in its `sys.path` variable. If the module is found, then\n",
    "the statements in the body of that module are run and the module is made *available* for you\n",
    "to use. Note that the initialization is done only the *first* time that we import a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `argv` variable in the `sys` module is accessed using the dotted notation i.e. `sys.argv`. It\n",
    "clearly indicates that this name is part of the `sys` module. Another advantage of this approach is\n",
    "that the name does not clash with any `argv` variable used in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sys.argv` variable is a *list* of strings. \n",
    "Specifically, the `sys.argv` contains the list of *command line arguments* i.e. the arguments passed to your program using the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, when we execute `python module_using_sys.py we are arguments`, we run the module\n",
    "`module_using_sys.py` with the `python` command and the other things that follow are arguments\n",
    "passed to the program. Python stores the command line arguments in the `sys.argv` variable for us\n",
    "to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the name of the script running is always the first argument in the `sys.argv` list. So,\n",
    "in this case we will have `'module_using_sys.py'` as `sys.argv[0]`, `'we'` as `sys.argv[1]`,\n",
    "`'are'` as `sys.argv[2]` and `'arguments'` as `sys.argv[3]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The from ... import statement\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to directly import the `argv` variable into your program \n",
    "(to avoid typing the `sys.`everytime for it), \n",
    "then you can use the `from sys import argv` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the `import` statement is better since your program will avoid name clashes and will be more readable.\n",

    "### Multiple imports\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import from many different modules. Imports are **always** put at the top of the file.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Make a script called `nuc_arg.py` that prints the nucleotide content of a sequence that you give as argument on the command line.\n",

    "$ python nuc_arg.py TGACTCA\n",

    "    * immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument list of a function call;\n",
    "    * immediately before the open parenthesis that starts an indexing or slicing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be sure to comment your code. \n",
    "* Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments. \n",

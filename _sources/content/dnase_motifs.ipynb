    "# Motifs in DNase I peaks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 12.1\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise for this week is to compare the relation between transcription factor motif presence and DNase I signal in different cell types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of your code should be a figure like the following (the values here are not real, but only shown for illustrative purposes):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1: Example heatmap for this exercise.](img/dnase_motifs_heatmap.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This heatmap shows, for every cell type and motif combination, the difference of the mean signal for regions with a motif compared to regions without a motif.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the directory `/scratch/cfb/dnase_motifs/` you will find two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DNase_table.tsv` \n",
    "* `motifs.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the human genome (version hg38) is present here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/scratch/genomes/hg38/hg38.fa`\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `DNase_table.tsv` looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 2: Contents of DNase_table.tsv.](img/dnase_table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tab-separated file contains DNase I signals for six hematopoietic cell types in 10,000 genomic regions. The DNase I reads were counted, log2 transformed and normalized by scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `motifs.txt` contains the name and consensus sequence for seven motifs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving sequences from a genome FASTA file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `pyfaidx` module to retrieve specific sequences from a FASTA file based on genomic coordinates. See the documentation of the module [here](https://pythonhosted.org/pyfaidx/).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you create a FASTA object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    from pyfaidx import Fasta\n",
    "    genome = Fasta(\"my_genome.fa\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can retrieve sequences in a dictionary-like approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_seq = genome[\"chr2\"][5000000:5000020]\n",
    "    print(my_seq.seq)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    TCATGACCATAGAGAACAGA\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about your approach before you start writing code!\n",
    "You will have to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* scan sequences with the motif consensus sequences;\n",
    "* determine, for every motif, which sequences have a match to the motif;\n",
    "* calculate the mean signal, depending on the motif occurrence;\n",
    "* calculate the difference in mean signal of sequences with a motif match and without a motif match.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make a correlation plot of the DNase signal in these hematopoietic cel types? Is this what you expect?\n",
    "* Which motifs are specific for certain cell types?\n",
    "* Does this agree with the literature?\n"

    "1. You are now going to write Python code to store a transcription factor regulatory network (Neph et al., Cell 2012) in a dictionary. Create a dictionary variable that contains all the regulatory relationships between the TFs in the Skeletal Muscle network shown below. The keys of the dictionary should be the names of the TFs. The value for each `key` (representing a TF) should be a `list` that contains the ***target genes*** of that TF. At the end of your code, print the dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/skeletal_muscle_myoblast_denovo_network.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do the same for the Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) network shown below, and print the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/embryonic_stem_cells_denovo_network.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write Python code that prints each target gene of OCT4 in the ESC network ***using a `for` loop***. To answer this question, first think of how you can retrieve the target genes of 'OCT4' (which is the `key`) from the ESC network dictionary. Use the name *targetGene* for the loop variable. Remember that the code needs to be able to produce the output when run in a new session of Python, so you need to include the definitions of the networks as well in your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write Python code that does the following:\n",
    " * Create a new empty dictionary named *mergedNetwork*\n",
    " * Store in *mergedNetwork* all the regulatory relationships that are present in the Muscle network dictionary. Use one for loop to iterate over the TFs stored as keys in the Muscle network dictionary.\n",
    " * Store in *mergedNetwork* all the regulatory relationships that are present in the ES cell network dictionary. Use again a for loop.\n",
    " * Print the *mergedNetwork*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write Python code that prints **all** the regulatory relationships stored in the *mergedNetwork* dictionary in the following format (here illustrated for the ES network, where \"->\" signifies that NANOG binds to the promoter of OCT4):\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "KLF4 -> KLF4\n",
    "KLF4 -> NANOG\n",
    "...\n",
    "NANOG -> OCT4\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 5.14**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to simulate in a very simplified and not necessarily realistic way the dynamics of a regulatory network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should have the following components:\n",
    " \n",
    " * Create a dictionary called *TFsBindingInPromoter* of the Muscle regulatory network (see picture above) in an alternative form: for each TF, this dictionary should store for each TF which TFs bind in its promoter. Note that this is a different way of representing the regulatory relationships than in the above exercise.  \n",
    " * Create a dictionary variable *TFState* that contains the *state* of each transcription factor. As the time proceeds, the state of the variables will be updated. Each transcription factor can be in one of two states. State *0* will represent the situation where the TF is not expressed; State *1* will represent the situation where the TF is expressed. Thus we will use numerical (`integer`) variables to track the state.\n",
    " * Put all the TFs in the 0 state (ie not expressed). Use a `for` loop to set the value to 0.\n",
    " * Put MEF2A in the expressed state (ie assign its state variable the value 1).\n",
    " * ***Dynamics*** Then simulate the dynamics of the regulatory network *in time* by assuming that all interactions between the TFs are ***positive***. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Each time the state of a TF is updated, print the state of the complete network (ie print the dictionary *TFState*).\n",
    "\n",
    "***How to write the Python code for the simulation of the dynamics*** \n",
    "\n",
    " * ***Loop 1*** The idea is to do 3 *time steps* and see how the state of the network changes (this defines your first for loop) \n",
    " * ***Loop 2*** At each *time step*, the state of all TFs in the networks are updated (this requires a second *nested* for loop, which is over TFs). \n",
    " * ***Loop 3*** A given TF is updated depending on the *state* of the TFs that bind in its promoter (e.g. MYF6). This therefore requires a third loop.\n",
    " If at least one of the TFs binding in the promoter are expressed, then the TF itself (the target) will become expressed. This is the consequence of our assumptions that all regulatory interactions are positive. It is also called an update rule. \n",
    " You will thus need a third *nested* `for` loop to iterate over all the TFs that bind in the promoter of the TF whose state is being updated. Within this for loop you need an `if` statement to determine if one of the input TFs is expressed. If so, then you change the state of the TF you are updating. \n",
    " * After you have checked all the inputs of a given TF and updated if necessary, print the state of the network as recorded in the dictionary *TFState*. \n",
    "\n",
    " * Finally, run the program and answer the following question: what is the final state of all the TFs in the network?\n",
    "\n",
    " * Now do exactly the same, but instead putting \"MEF2A\" in the expressed state, put \"MYOD\" in the expressed state. Experiment with the number of time steps. What do you see? Is the end result the same? Explain how this result follows from the structure of the network. What does this tell you about the biology of differentiation of muscle cells (assuming the model and simulation are correct)? Is this conclusion biologically valid (bonus question)?\n",
